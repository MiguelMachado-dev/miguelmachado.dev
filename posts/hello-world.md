## I'm not just "a strange man behind the keyboard"

Hey, how are you?
I'm Miguel Machado, a full stack developer **from Brazil**, I have about 2 years of experience in the programming field

I always dreamt about having my blog, so, why not build my own?!

### Why I developed this blog?

I always loved to show others what I've created and what I've learned. _I kinda like the idea of teaching_ **and it's my chance to improve my English!**

### The mission

I'm planning to be publishing at least one post per week.

And I hope I can always bring some content that helps or teaches something!

### What I am going to be blogging about?

I'm going to post about development, some tips I learned during my developer career and the sooner you learn it, the better! And I can't forget **Science**, because, well, I ❤️ Science!

#### Note:

**Any typos or grammar errors? Let me know in the comments section!**

That's it for today, devs! Stick around for more content!
